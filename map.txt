Multi vendor

1. multi-vendor marketplace is an online store where multiple vendors or sellers can list and sell their products and services in one single location. The owner of the multi-vendor platform then takes a cut of the transaction (commission).

2. Setting up a multi-vendor marketplace platform takes away much of the traditional burden associated with creating an online store since you donâ€™t have to deal with inventory management or find suppliers; just recruit quality vendors and make sure they adhere to your rules and regulations.

3. Challenges of running a multi-vendor website include start-up costs, finding quality sellers, and marketing the site to bring customers in.

4. Multi-vendor marketplace platforms are typically separated into two distinct versions.

The other is a services marketplace, where the platform vendors are selling a service or rental (Uber, Airbnb, Angi).
